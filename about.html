				<h1>About</h1><em>	
				<strong><p id = "catchphrase">Throughout human history, traditions, knowledge, and ideas have all passed through generations via the medium of stories. At 90 + 1', we believe in the power of compelling storytelling. We want to show the world that Football, is more than just a game played over 90 minutes. </p></strong></em>

Stories featuerd by us are written by people all over the road and chosen by our trusted team of editors, containing a variety of topics, ranging from moments that defined the Beautiful Game, to inspiring stories of a small town club that made it to the top. We hope that our stories would enhance the footballing experience of our readers, allowing them to gain something after clicking on any of our stories. </p>
